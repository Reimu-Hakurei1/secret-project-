## Guidelines for Security Testing

To protect users and data, please follow these rules during research:

- Do **not** perform actions that may damage the service (e.g., DDoS, spam, automated attacks).  
- Do **not** access, modify, or delete real user data.  
- Avoid publishing Firebase keys, tokens, or sensitive config files publicly — report them privately.
